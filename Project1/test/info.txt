Generally, a large code base project contains multiple modules and hence requires multiple test modules.

It is always good to keep all test modules as a unit and separate it from development code.

A Test package is nothing but a python package containing all test modules in it.

Create a test package by following the below steps.

Create a folder named Project1.
Create a subfolder named test in Project1.
Create a file named __init__.py in Project1/test folder.
Move the file test_module1.py into Project1/test folder.
Add the expression into all = ['test_module1'] into __init__.py file and save it.
The folder test now acts like a test package. You can also add any number of test modules to test directory.

##################################################

Once the test package is created, run tests present in
test_module1.py file with below command from Project1 folder.

python -m unittest test.test_module1
<command throws syntax error. so, something is incorrect>
